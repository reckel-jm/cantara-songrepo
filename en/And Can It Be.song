#title: And Can It Be
#author: Charles Wesley | Robert Elkins | Thomas Campbell

And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Savior's blood
Died He for me who caused His pain
For me who Him to death pursued
Amazing love how can it be
That Thou my God shouldst die for me
Amazing love how can it be
That Thou my God shouldst die for me

'Tis mystery all th'Immortal dies
Who can explore His strange design
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine
'Tis mercy all let earth adore
Let angel minds inquire no more
'Tis mercy all let earth adore
Let angel minds inquire no more

He left His Father's throne above
So free so infinite His grace
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race
'Tis mercy all immense and free
For O my God it found out me
'Tis mercy all immense and free
For O my God it found out me

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke the dungeon flamed with light
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee

No condemnation now I dread
Jesus and all in Him is mine
Alive in Him my living Head
And clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach th'eternal throne
And claim the crown through Christ my own
Bold I approach th'eternal throne
And claim the crown through Christ my own
